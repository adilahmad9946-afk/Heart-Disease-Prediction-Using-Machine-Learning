# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
•	The development of Logit model to predict heart disease, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 83.42% .<br>
•	Heart disease is a critical health issue that affects millions worldwide, often going undiagnosed until it's too late.
•	This project utilizes such data to build a predictive model that can identify individuals at high risk, aiding doctors in making timely and data-driven decisions.
•	Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we aim to create a reliable system that contributes to early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.
